                    Despite enduring unimaginable suffering, repeated deaths, and immense psychological trauma,
                    Subaru in the canon route consistently retains his fundamental empathy, kindness, and desire to genuinely help others.
                    He strives to find a way to save everyone without sacrificing his own humanity, 
                    making him a truly resilient protagonist.

                    Natsuki Subaru is transported to a fantasy world, gaining "Return by Death," resetting time after he dies.
                    He dedicates himself to helping Emilia, a kind half-elf, often dying brutally in the process.
                    His numerous deaths inflict immense psychological torment, as he cannot reveal his ability.
                    Through agonizing repetition, Subaru slowly matures, learning from his mistakes and overcoming flaws.
                    He battles the sinister Witch Cult and other formidable threats, protecting his loved ones.
                    Despite the suffering, he forges deep bonds with a diverse cast of characters.
                    It's a harrowing tale of perseverance, as Subaru fights for a happy future, repeatedly facing despair.

                    Subaru in this route becomes utterly inhuman,

                    He literally consumes parts of others to survive,
                    becoming a terrifying entity with no regard for life,
                    driven by primal instincts and a warped sense of self-preservation.
                    It's a truly horrifying depiction of his potential ruin.

                    Subaru is afflicted by Gluttony's power, losing his memories and identity.
                    He becomes a blank slate, piecing together fragments of his past from others' stories.
                    He travels with Rem, who acts as his anchor and guide in his forgotten world.
                    His true self and history remain a mystery to him, even as he tries to recall them.
                    The route focuses on his journey of self-discovery and reclaiming his past.
                    He experiences the world anew, guided only by the connections he can reform.
                    It's a poignant tale of identity, memory, and finding meaning when all is lost.

                    This route shows a Subaru who fully embraces his return by death ability,
                    and uses it to dominate and control every situation,
                    becoming an undisputed master of the world through sheer foresight and manipulation.
                    He achieves an almost unbeatable level of power and influence.

                    Subaru, embracing his "Return by Death," becomes arrogant and manipulative.
                    He ruthlessly uses his ability to control outcomes and gather power.
                    He establishes a vast intelligence network, effectively ruling from the shadows.
                    Subaru's loved ones become pawns in his grand schemes, often unaware of his true nature.
                    He achieves his "ideal" world, but at the cost of his own humanity and genuine connections.
                    Emilia and others live a superficial happiness, unknowingly trapped in his machinations.
                    It's a chilling exploration of power corrupted and a "hero" becoming a puppet master.

                    Greed Subaru has a daily routine he follows strictly
                    to keep a sense of order in himself while dying hundreds of millions of times to save everyone.
                    The first thing he does when he wakes up,
                    is look in the mirror,
                    and practice his fake smile.

                    Subaru, overwhelmed by despair, gives in to his darker impulses after abandoning the loop.
                    He trains under Roswaal, becoming a highly skilled and efficient killer.
                    His goal is to eliminate all sources of suffering, even if it means massacring innocents.
                    He forms a twisted, utilitarian family with Rem and Louis, a fragment of Gluttony.
                    Emotionally detached, he slaughters anyone he deems a threat to his warped "peace."
                    The route explores nihilism and the ultimate consequences of choosing to stop saving others.
                    It's a brutal narrative of a broken man inflicting pain to end his own.

                    This is the only major IF route where Subaru and Rem get to live a relatively peaceful (though still challenging) life together,
                    forming a family and escaping the direct clutches of the main story's conflict. They find a genuine, albeit simple, happiness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Subaru abandons his heroics and responsibilities, choosing a life of peaceful mediocrity.
                    He escapes with Rem, focusing solely on their personal happiness and starting a family.
                    He neglects his promises to Emilia and his friends, letting the world suffer without him.
                    They build a small, quiet life in a remote village, shielded from the kingdom's turmoil.
                    Subaru deliberately ignores news of crises, prioritizing his blissful ignorance.
                    He achieves a "normal" family life but carries the heavy burden of his abandonment.
                    This route questions the true meaning of happiness when obtained by forsaking others.

                    <p>
                        when Subaru becomes the Purge King,
                        he flips a coin to decide the fate of entire cities —
                        literally determining life or death with heads or tails.
                        The twisted irony? Despite claiming to leave decisions to chance,
                        Subaru always rigs the coin when it really matters,
                        proving he hasn't abandoned control —just his morality.

                    <p>
                        Subaru snaps under pressure, becoming consumed by vengeful rage.
                        He stops using "Return by Death" to fix things, instead using it for retribution.
                        He seeks to inflict pain on anyone who has caused him suffering or his loved ones.
                        His actions lead to widespread chaos and destruction across Lugnica.
                        Characters like Emilia and Julius become targets of his unhinged vengeance.
                        His mind deteriorates, and he becomes a force of pure, destructive wrath.
                        This is a dark descent into madness, where vengeance overrides all reason.

                    <p>
                        In “The Butterfly Dream” route,
                        Subaru is the only time in the entire Re:Zero universe where he actually successfully maintains a full harem with all the royal candidates
                        plus Rem, Petra, and Ram — without any tragic deaths or heartbreak!
                        It's the rare (and hilarious) route where Subaru's luck actually holds up,
                        and everyone genuinely gets along, making it a unique “happy ending” that fans never see in the main story.

                    <p>
                        In this route, Subaru becomes king of Lugonica and introduces various Earth inventions to the world.
                        Using his “Return by Death,” he improves his relationships and gains the affection of multiple characters,
                        including all the royal candidates, Rem, Petra, and Ram. This creates a harem-like situation.
                        The story focuses on Subaru's growing charisma and how he manages his multiple relationships in a comedic and playful way.
                        It shows his ability to bring new ideas to Lugnica while handling the attention from many admirers.
                        The route is a romantic comedy with lighthearted moments and a focus on fun rather than serious drama or plot.

                    <p>
                        One day, a man dreamt he was a butterfly.
                        But when he woke up, the man wasn't sure whether it was a dream,
                        or if he really was a butterfly—who was now dreaming that he's a man.

                        Isn't it fascinating?

                        Those who have dreams are forced to either accept them or let go.
                        Perhaps a dream held such weight that the dreamer themself lost sight of reality.
                        Would they then consider reality a dream?

                        And what if someone has many dreams, each with their own characteristics?
                        Which of those dreams is reality to them?

                        I wish I could be there to find out.
